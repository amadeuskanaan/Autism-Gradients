The Autism Gradients project came about from a BrainHack collaboration. 

It was recently shown by Margulies et al (2016) that the principal gradients of cortical connectivity can be situated spatially along the default mode network. In addition these principal gradients appear to almost linearly follow a hierarchy in terms of levels of cognitive processing. Autism is a developmental condition that has often been speculated to involve alteration in connectivity and in addition has been shown to effect different cognitive processes at different levels. 

As such, in the present project we sought to explore the use of cortical connectivity gradients to assess potential differences in cortical hierarchy in individuals with autism.

If you're interested in the project, please take a look at the [collection of iPython notebooks for the project](https://autism-research-centre.github.io/Autism-Gradients/notebooks.html).
