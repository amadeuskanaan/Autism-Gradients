### Get set up
Make sure you have anaconda or miniconda installed. This provides you with a good way to manage your python repositories, and allows you to simply install all dependencies for this project by using the provided environment.yml file.

Find it here:

https://conda.io/miniconda.html

You should also have `git` installed, since some packages used in this project are only available from github.

If you have both git and miniconda or anaconda installed, start by cloning this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/rb643/Autism-Gradients`

To manage all the required packages, we’ll create a new conda environment. These environments simply clone your root environment (so they will have everything you normally have installed) and then install packages listed in the environment file _only for that environment_. If you stop working on this project, you’ll be able to simply delete the environment, and all the packages will be uninstalled.

1. Open a terminal or a cmd prompt.
2. Change directory (cd) to the repository folder. If you ran `git clone …` (above) in your home folder, the repository should be reachable by typing `cd ~/Autism-Gradients` on OSX or Linux.
3. Create a conda environment from the environment.yml file using the following command: `conda env create -n rbbrainhack -f environment.yml`.
    - It will ask you if you want to go ahead and install all the packages - simply press `enter`.
4. Then activate this environment: `source activate rbbrainhack` on Linux/OSX, `activate rbbrainhack` on Windows.
    - Whenever you stop working on this, you can type `source deactivate rbbrainhack` to return to your normal python installation, or simply close your terminal and open a new one.
5. Type `jupiter notebook`. This will open a browser window that displays the content of your home directory. Click on the files ending in `.ipynb` to open them and run the code!

__If you have any issues with the above, simply open an issue on this github repository!__
