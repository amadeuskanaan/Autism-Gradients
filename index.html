description: "Owen Parsons - Psychiatry Researcher"
---
<p>I am currently working towards a PhD in Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. My project focuses on the roles of expectation and uncertainty affect perceptual decision making in individuals with autism spectrum conditions. You can find out a bit more about my research by going to my projects pages.</p>

<p>I'm also very interested in science communication and the use of scientific research in policy. I'm the editor for my department's news site which can be found here. I also work on a science-policy podcast for the Cambridge University Science and Policy Exchange (CUSPE) which can be found here.</p>

<p>I write the occasional blog post about things such as autism research, autism policy, neuroscience, statistics and data science. You can find a full list of posts here or can see my latest posts directly under this.</p>
